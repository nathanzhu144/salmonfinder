Setting up locally: 

1. Make a file called "password.txt" in your home directory, note that .gitignore will ignore this file, and thus this file
   should not be pushed up to git.
2. Replace the email with a functional gmail, and put the password of that email in the "password.txt"
3. Make sure signing on with less secure methods is turned on.
